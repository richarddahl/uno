# Event Package Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the `events` package in the Uno framework. The goal is to:

1. Restructure the events package to focus on its core responsibilities
2. Move technology-specific implementations to their appropriate packages
3. Use Protocols for composition-based type checking instead of inheritance
4. Eliminate code duplication across packages
5. Ensure all code follows Uno's idiomatic patterns

## Core Issues

Current analysis reveals several structural issues:

1. The `events` package contains code that belongs in other packages (projections, persistence, sagas)
2. Some implementations inherit from Protocols rather than implementing them structurally
3. There's potential code duplication across packages
4. The `events` package should only contain in-memory implementations for development and testing

## Refactoring Strategy

The refactoring will be organized into the following phases:

1. **Protocol Refactoring** - Ensure all protocols follow Uno's idioms
2. **Base Classes Relocation** - Move domain objects and base classes to appropriate packages
3. **Implementation Migration** - Move technology-specific implementations to their packages
4. **Integration and Testing** - Ensure everything works together after refactoring
5. **Linting** - Ignore linting errors in the refactoring process

## Detailed Action Items

### 1. Protocols Refactoring

#### 1.1. Event-related Protocols

- [x] Audit `events/protocols.py` to identify which protocols are truly event-specific
- [x] Remove inheritance from Protocol classes and use `@runtime_checkable` consistently
- [x] Ensure all Protocols have proper name suffixes (e.g., `EventBusProtocol`)
- [x] Verify generic type parameters are properly defined (contravariant for inputs, covariant for outputs)

#### 1.2. Command-related Protocols

- [x] Move `CommandHandler` from `events/protocols.py` to a new `commands/protocols.py` module
- [x] Update imports and ensure all dependent code points to the new location

#### 1.3. Event Store Protocols

- [x] Move `EventStoreProtocol` to `persistence/event_sourcing/protocols.py`
- [x] Update all references to point to the new location

### 2. Base Classes Relocation

#### 2.1. Domain Event Base Classes

- [x] Keep `DomainEvent` and `EventMetadata` in `events/base_event.py` (these are core to events)
- [x] Remove any implementation-specific details from these base classes

#### 2.2. Event Handler Base Classes

- [x] Convert `EventHandler` and `EventHandlerMiddleware` from ABC to Protocol in `events/protocols.py`
- [x] Update error handling to use the standard Uno error pattern

- [x] Update imports throughout the codebase

### 3. Implementation Migration

#### 3.1. Event Bus Implementations

- [x] Keep `InMemoryEventBus` in `events/implementations/bus.py` (for testing/dev)
- [x] Remove class inheritance from `EventBusProtocol`, use structural typing

### 5. Import and Dependency Updates

#### 5.1. Public API Updates

  - There is an `__init__.py.new` file in the events package that has proper imports and organization
  - The commands package `__init__.py` has been updated with both old and new implementations
- [ ] Add proper `__all__` declarations following isort ordering
  - The commands package has an `__all__` declaration but it appears to be incomplete
  - The events package new init file has exports but no explicit `__all__` declaration
- [ ] Document breaking changes for migration
  - Documentation of breaking changes is not yet visible in the codebase

#### 5.2. Imports Audit

- [x] Audit all imports throughout the codebase
  - New imports follow proper TYPE_CHECKING guards in implementation files
  - Import structure properly separates protocol imports from implementation imports
- [x] Fix circular imports if any are created during refactoring
  - TYPE_CHECKING guards are being used throughout the codebase to prevent circular imports

  - This pattern is consistently applied in the refactored code

#### 5.3. DI Container Updates  

- [ ] Update dependency injection bindings
  - No clear evidence that all DI container bindings have been updated
- [ ] Ensure services are registered in the correct packages
  - Work needed to verify and update service registrations

## Testing Strategy for Refactored Components

To ensure the refactored code maintains functionality and follows best practices, we need a comprehensive testing approach:

### Unit Testing

1. **Protocol Implementation Tests**
   - Verify that implementations correctly satisfy their respective protocols
   - Test with type checkers to confirm structural compatibility
   - Ensure runtime behavior matches protocol specifications

2. **DI Container Resolution Tests**
   - Test that services can be properly registered and resolved
   - Verify correct implementation is used based on configuration
   - Test fallback behavior for missing configurations

3. **Event Bus Implementation Tests**
   - Test publishing events through both in-memory and Postgres implementations
   - Verify events are properly propagated to subscribers
   - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

4. **Event Store Implementation Tests**
   - Test saving and retrieving events from both in-memory and Postgres stores
   - Verify events maintain consistency and ordering
   - Test querying capabilities for event retrieval

5. **Command Bus Implementation Tests**
   - Test dispatching commands through both structural and memory implementations
   - Verify commands reach the correct handlers
   - Test middleware execution and handler resolution

### Integration Testing

1. **Cross-Package Integration**
   - Test interaction between events, commands, and persistence packages
   - Verify command handling that results in event publication
   - Test event handlers that trigger command dispatch

2. **End-to-End Scenarios**
   - Implement tests for complete use cases involving multiple components
   - Test with both in-memory and Postgres implementations
   - Verify backward compatibility with existing client code

3. **Configuration-Based Testing**
   - Test behavior with different configuration settings
   - Verify fallback mechanisms work correctly
   - Test runtime switching between implementations

### Migration Testing

1. **Compatibility Verification**
   - Test that existing code using old imports still works
   - Verify backward compatibility aliases function correctly
   - Ensure deprecated interfaces provide proper warnings

2. **Migration Guide Validation**
   - Test code examples provided in the migration guide
   - Verify step-by-step migration instructions are accurate
   - Test incremental migration approaches

### Testing Tools and Infrastructure

1. **Type Checking**
   - Use mypy with strict settings to verify protocol implementations
   - Test for proper generic type usage
   - Verify no type errors are introduced by the refactoring

2. **Runtime Testing**
   - Use pytest fixtures for consistent test environments
   - Implement proper test isolation to prevent cross-test contamination
   - Create parameterized tests to validate behavior across implementations

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Update CI workflows to test the refactored codebase
   - Add specific tests to verify backward compatibility
   - Implement performance benchmarks to detect regressions

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Set up test fixtures for both in-memory and Postgres implementations
2. Implement protocol compliance tests for all refactored components
3. Create integration tests for cross-package functionality
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing client code
5. Update CI/CD workflows to include the new tests
