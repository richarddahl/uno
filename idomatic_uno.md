# idiomatic uno

- The framework is async first!
- Use modern python type hints with primitives (dict, type, list etc...) not Dict, Type, List, etc...
- Use X | Y not Union[X, Y]
- Use X & Y not Intersection[X, Y]
 -Use X -> Y not Callable[[X], Y]
- Use X | None not Optional[X]
- Use X | Y | Z not Union[X, Y, Z]
- Use X | Y | Z | None not Optional[X | Y | Z]
- Use pydantic 2 for data validation
- Use modern implementations of library, with NO deprecation warnings triggered
- Use python 3.13
- Use black and ruff for formatting and linting
- Use mypy for type checking
- Tests are run with: hatch run test:testV
- Test framework is pytest
- Use hatch for dependency management
- All arguments (except of course cls and self), are typed using python 3.13 style
- All methods and functions type thier return type
- Tests are written to the same clean-code standards as core code
- MockObject or FakeObject but never, ever: TestObject
- Prefer Protocol over ABC whenever possible
- Protocols define interfaces, in pkg specific protocols.py modules, and use them for type hinting
- Protocols are defined with the Protocol suffix
- Concrete implementations are defined outside protocols.py and have no suffix
- All imports are properly formatted and ordered
- All public API symbols are listed in __init__.__all__ in proper isort ordering
