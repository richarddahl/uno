# Order Bounded Context

This package contains all aggregates, events, and value objects specific to the Order domain.

- Place all order-specific domain logic here.
- Use `events.py` for order events.
- Use `order.py` for aggregates/entities.
- Add value objects here if they are only relevant to the Order context; otherwise, keep them in `domain/value_objects.py`.
