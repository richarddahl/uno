# Configuration System Issues

This document outlines potential issues and improvements for the Uno configuration system.

## Implementation Issue## Security Issue

4. **Insufficient Validation of Secure Values**: No validation that secure values meet minimum security requirements (for passwords, etc.) before encryption.

## Documentation Issues

1. **Incomplete DocStrings**: Some methods lack comprehensive documentation about their behavior, especially around error conditions and edge cases.

2. **Missing Examples**: Lack of usage examples for complex features like encrypting configuration values or handling environment variable overrides.

3. **Insufficient Security Guidelines**: Limited guidance on best practices for handling master keys in production environments or rotating encryption keys.

## Testing Considerations

1. **Mocking Challenges**: The current design might be difficult to test due to tight coupling between components and the mix of sync/async operations.

2. **Production Environment Testing**: No specific guidance on how to safely test configuration in production-like environments without exposing secrets.

3. **Test Coverage for Edge Cases**: The complex environment variable resolution and secure value type handling have many edge cases that would benefit from extensive testing.

## Performance Concerns

1. **Repeated Environment Scanning**: The code repeatedly scans the entire environment for variables, which could be inefficient for systems with many environment variables.

2. **Inefficient Type Conversion**: Some type conversion operations may be inefficient, especially for complex nested types.

3. **Multiple File I/O Operations**: The environment file loading performs multiple file I/O operations that could be optimized.

## Improvement Recommendations

1. **Consistent Async/Sync Boundary**: Decide on clear async/sync boundaries and refactor accordingly:
   - Make `SecureValue.setup_encryption()` truly async if it needs to be async
   - Consider making `UnoSettings.from_env()` async to match the async nature of the framework

2. **Enhanced Security Features**:
   - Add support for key rotation
   - Implement secure memory handling with explicit memory clearing
   - Strengthen validation of secure values

3. **Type System Improvements**:
   - Follow the project's type annotation standards consistently
   - Use Python 3.13 type syntax throughout
   - Replace cast operations with more precise type narrowing

4. **Improved Error Messages**: Enhance error messages with more context for easier debugging, especially for environment variable resolution failures.

5. **Configuration Layering**: Consider implementing a more robust configuration layering system with clearer precedence rules and better documentation.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache environment variable lookups
   - Optimize file I/O operations
   - Simplify the complex alias resolution logic
