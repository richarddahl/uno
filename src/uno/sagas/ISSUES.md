# Uno Saga Management System – Issues and Review (2025-05-13)

## General Principles & Uno Compliance

- [ ] **Type Hint Consistency:**  
  Sweep for legacy typing (`Any`, etc.) and ensure all type hints use modern Python 3.13+ idioms (`dict[str, X]`, `X | None`).
  - Some files use `Any` for event/command/state data—clarify or narrow types where possible.

- [ ] **Protocol/ABC Usage:**  
  Protocols are used for interfaces (`SagaProtocol`, `SagaStoreProtocol`), with correct structural typing (no inheritance from Protocol).
  - Ensure all implementations are checked against their protocols (e.g., `InMemorySagaStore`).
  - Protocol/interface names end with `Protocol`; concrete classes do not.

- [ ] **Error Handling:**  
  Custom errors (`SagaError`, `SagaStoreError`, `SagaNotFoundError`, `SagaAlreadyExistsError`, `SagaCompensationError`) are defined and inherit from `UnoError`.
  - Ensure all error raising and handling is explicit and uses these types, not generic exceptions.
  - Audit for direct `raise Exception` or similar anti-patterns.

## Implementation & Structure

- [ ] **Async/Sync Consistency:**  
  All store and manager operations are async, which is good. Confirm all APIs and implementations maintain async consistency.
  - Consider providing sync adapters if needed for legacy or test code.

- [ ] **In-Memory Implementation:**  
  `InMemorySagaStore` is an async, in-memory store.
  - Ensure thread safety if used in concurrent scenarios (currently uses a plain dict without locks).

- [ ] **Saga Orchestration Logic:**  
  `SagaManager` manages lifecycle, event handling, state persistence, and error recovery.
  - Ensure orchestration logic is robust and covers all DDD saga/process manager patterns (e.g., compensation, idempotency, recovery).

- [ ] **Extensibility:**  
  Document how to add new saga types, stores, or error types for contributors.
  - Ensure the interface for adding new persistent backends is clear and idiomatic.

## Documentation, Testability, and Maintainability

- [ ] **Internal Documentation:**  
  Most classes and methods have docstrings, but review for completeness and clarity, especially for maintainers.
  - Add/expand documentation for contributors.

- [ ] **Test Coverage:**  
  No evidence of comprehensive unit tests for:
    - Protocol/store compliance
    - Async store operations
    - Error handling (store errors, not found, compensation, etc.)
    - Orchestration logic and edge cases
  - Add/expand tests for these scenarios.

- [ ] **Examples:**  
  Ensure all major patterns (saga definition, store usage, error handling, compensation) are covered in `examples.py` or equivalent.

- [ ] **Dead Code:**  
  Remove any dead code, stubs, or unused helpers.

## Minor/Other Issues

- [ ] **Circular Imports:**  
  Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guards, but audit for possible circular import issues, especially between protocols, stores, and errors.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Sweep for type hint modernization and protocol compliance.
- Ensure async consistency and robust error handling.
- Expand documentation and test coverage.
- Audit for circular imports, dead code, and maintainability.
