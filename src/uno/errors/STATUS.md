# Uno Error System Status

## Overview

The Uno error system provides a comprehensive framework for structured error handling with rich context, categorization, and integration capabilities. It follows the principle that errors should be informative, categorizable, and carry contextual information to aid debugging and monitoring.

## Current Implementation

The error system currently implements:

- **Core Error Types**: A hierarchy of specialized error classes for different components and scenarios.
- **Context Enrichment**: Mechanisms to add contextual information to errors as they propagate.
- **Async Support**: Basic async-context tracking and propagation.
- **Integration Hooks**: Preliminary integration with FastAPI and basic logging capabilities.
- **Error Categorization**: Classification by component and severity.
- **Exception Wrapping**: Utilities to wrap external exceptions with rich context.

## Strengths

- Comprehensive error hierarchy with specialized types for different components
- Rich context propagation across async boundaries
- Support for both sync and async code patterns
- Structured error codes with component prefixes
- Well-designed factory functions for common error creation patterns
- Preliminary support for FastAPI integration

## Issues and Gaps

While the foundation is solid, several issues need addressing to make the error system truly async-first, production-ready, and seamlessly integrated with other Uno components.

### 1. Async Integration Issues

- **Inconsistent Async Context Propagation**: The current implementation may lose context across certain async boundaries, especially with complex task hierarchies.
- **Task Creation Tracking**: No tracking of context across dynamically created tasks with `asyncio.create_task()`.
- **Event Loop Integration**: Limited integration with asyncio event loops for systematic error handling.

### 2. Integration with Other Uno Components

- **DI Container Integration**: While there's a `di.py` module, the integration with the actual DI container needs refinement.
- **Logging System Integration**: Current logging integration is basic and not fully compatible with structured logging patterns.
- **Configuration System Integration**: No clear mechanism to load error-related configuration (severity levels, context masking, etc.).
- **Domain & Events Integration**: Limited support for domain-driven design patterns and event sourcing.

### 3. Production Readiness Gaps

- **Performance Concerns**: Context enrichment may have performance implications in high-throughput scenarios.
- **Memory Usage**: Storing extensive context and stack traces could lead to memory bloat.
- **Thread Safety**: Some global state management may not be fully thread-safe.
- **Testing Coverage**: Insufficient test coverage, especially for edge cases.

### 4. Usability Concerns

- **Documentation Gaps**: Limited examples of recommended patterns for error handling.
- **Complexity**: The rich feature set might be overwhelming for simple use cases.
- **Default Configurations**: Missing sensible defaults for common scenarios.
- **Middleware Consistency**: FastAPI middleware implementation differs from other frameworks.

## Integration Checklist

## Tasks to Complete

The following tasks should be completed to address the identified gaps and issues:

### 1. Async-First Improvements

- [ ] Implement task creation wrappers to maintain error context
- [ ] Integrate with asyncio task factories
- [ ] Add context propagation for concurrent operations

### 5. Advanced Features

- [ ] Add support for error aggregation
- [ ] Implement retry policies tied to error categories
- [ ] Create circuit breaker patterns based on error frequency
- [ ] Add distributed tracing integration

## Priorities

Based on the analysis, these tasks should be prioritized in the following order:

1. **Fix Async Context Propagation**: Ensure reliable context flow across all async boundaries
2. **Complete DI and Config Integration**: Connect to the core Uno infrastructure
3. **Enhance Logging Integration**: Ensure errors are properly logged with full context
4. **Improve Documentation**: Make the system more approachable with clear examples
5. **Optimize Performance**: Address any efficiency concerns for production use

## Conclusion

The Uno error system provides a solid foundation for structured error handling but requires additional work to fully realize its potential as an async-first, production-ready, integrated component of the Uno ecosystem. The tasks outlined in this document will address the current gaps and enhance the system's usability, reliability, and integration capabilities.
