# Uno DI System Status

## Current Implementation

The Uno DI (Dependency Injection) system currently provides:

- A container implementation (`Container`) conforming to `ContainerProtocol`
- Service registration mechanism via `ServiceRegistration` implementing `ServiceRegistrationProtocol`
- Support for different service lifetimes (`Lifetime` enum)
- Factory protocols for both sync and async service creation
- A scoping system via `ScopeProtocol`
- Error types for various DI-related failures

The system appears to have been designed with both synchronous and asynchronous operations in mind, as evidenced by the presence of both `ServiceFactoryProtocol` and `AsyncServiceFactoryProtocol`.

## Issues Preventing Production Readiness

Based on the current implementation as visible in the package's public API, several issues may prevent the DI system from being fully async-first, production-ready, and well-integrated with the rest of the Uno ecosystem:

1. **Async-First Implementation Concerns**:
   - The existence of both sync and async factory protocols suggests potential issues with consistently preferring async operations
   - No clear indication of how async resolution chains are handled
   - Potential for deadlocks or blocking operations in async contexts

2. **Integration with Uno Ecosystem**:
   - No visible integration with uno.config for configuration-based registrations
   - No integration with uno.logging for debugging and tracing DI operations
   - No apparent integration with uno.errors for standardized error handling
   - No indication of integration with domain and event systems

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Unclear if there are performance optimizations for large-scale service graphs
   - No indication of thread safety guarantees
   - Lack of utility methods for common DI scenarios
