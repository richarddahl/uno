# Uno Event Sourcing System Status

## Current Implementation

The Uno event sourcing system currently provides:

- A robust `DomainEvent` base class with versioning, serialization, and integrity validation
- Standard event types for common operations (`DeletedEvent`, `RestoredEvent`)
- Protocol definitions for key components (`EventBusProtocol`, `EventPublisherProtocol`, `EventHandlerProtocol`)
- In-memory implementations for event bus and event store
- Event handling infrastructure with middleware support
- Handler registration and discovery mechanisms
- Various event-related utilities and context objects
- Integration with the Uno error system
- Factory functions for global service access
- Configuration via `EventsConfig`
- Snapshot management for optimizing aggregate rehydration

The system demonstrates thoughtful design with a strong focus on async operations, clear abstractions, and separation of concerns. However, several areas need improvement to be fully production-ready.

## Issues Preventing Production Readiness

### Async-First Implementation

1. **Inconsistent Async Patterns**:
   - Some handlers may not be properly awaited in all places
   - Limited support for concurrent event processing
   - Lack of explicit cancellation handling in async operations

2. **Blocking Operations**:
   - Some operations (like handler execution) may block the event loop
   - Insufficient batching mechanisms for high-throughput scenarios

### Integration with Uno Ecosystem

1. **DI Integration Gaps**:
   - The current DI integration is incomplete and inconsistent
   - Not all services are properly injectable
   - Factory patterns could be better aligned with DI principles

2. **Logging Integration**:
   - Current logging implementation doesn't follow all Uno logging best practices
   - Structured logging could be more comprehensive

3. **Configuration System**:
   - Direct environment variable access instead of using the Uno config system
   - Limited validation of configuration settings

4. **Event Storage**:
   - Lack of robust production-ready event storage implementations
   - Insufficient handling of storage failures and retries

### Production Readiness Concerns

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Limited batching capabilities for event publishing/processing
   - No clear strategies for handling high-volume event streams
   - Snapshot strategy implementation is incomplete

2. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Lack of failover mechanisms
   - Limited error recovery strategies
   - Insufficient transaction guarantees

3. **Observability**:
   - Insufficient metrics for monitoring
   - Limited debugging tools and introspection capabilities

4. **Security**:
   - Basic event hash implementation but lacking comprehensive security features
   - No event encryption mechanisms

5. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Limited testing utilities for event sourcing components
   - No comprehensive test harnesses for event workflows
